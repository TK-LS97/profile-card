## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned
This project was a good way to reinforce my flexbox knowledge in css, as well as learning how to work with background images and manipulating them.

The knowledge I got here was cropping the background images to make a really cool effect:

```css
.big-container{
    background-image: url(/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg),url(/images/bg-pattern-top.svg);
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    background-position: left 45vw top 44vh,right 48vw bottom 40vh;
}
```



### Continued development
I liked using flexbox and I look forward to using it again. I also want to get more projects involving flexbox to learn how to use more flexbox properties.

I also want to get familiar with images, it's quite attractive seeing a well designed website with background images that appear seemless and easy on the eye, and that's what I aim for.
